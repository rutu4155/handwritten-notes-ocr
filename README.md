# Handwritten Notes OCR using PHP & Tesseract  

🚀 **Convert handwritten text into digital format with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) using PHP and Tesseract!**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses **Tesseract OCR** with **PHP** to scan and extract text from handwritten notes. It helps in digitizing handwritten content, making it more accessible and editable.  

## 🛠️ Features  
✅ Extract text from handwritten images  
✅ Supports different handwriting styles  
✅ Image preprocessing for better accuracy  
✅ PHP-Tesseract integration

## 🔧 Installation & Setup  

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone (https://github.com/rutu4155/handwritten-notes-ocr)
cd handwritten-notes-ocr

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
PHP (Make sure PHP is installed)
Tesseract OCR (Install it based on your OS)
For Windows:
Download and install Tesseract from: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract

For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
## 3️⃣ Run the Project (Using XAMPP)  

1. **Move the Project to XAMPP’s `htdocs` Folder**  
   - Copy your project folder (`handwritten-notes-ocr`) to:  
     ```
     C:\xampp\htdocs\
     ```

2. **Start Apache & MySQL in XAMPP**  
   - Open **XAMPP Control Panel**  
   - Start **Apache** (You don’t need MySQL unless your project stores OCR data in a database)  

3. **Run the PHP Script in Browser**  
   - Open your browser and go to:  
     ```
     http://localhost/handwritten-notes-ocr/
     ```

4. **Upload an Image & Get Extracted Text**  
   - The script will process the image and display the extracted text
## 📜 Usage
Upload an image, and the script will process it using Tesseract OCR to extract text. The extracted text will be displayed or saved in a file.

## 🏆 Technologies Used
